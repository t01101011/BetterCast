// Lets liquidDX11's D3D11 render loop drive BetterCast's real Qt core.
//
// Two things had to be true before this was possible, and both now are:
//
//   1. The core is widget-free. Capture, encode, the virtual display driver,
//      discovery and the network layer used to include MainWindow.h just to
//      reach LogManager, dragging QMainWindow in with it. Lifting LogManager
//      out means those objects can be linked by any front end.
//
//   2. A full QApplication, not QCoreApplication. Widgets stay available, so
//      the existing VideoWindow that shows received video keeps working
//      unchanged while the main UI is a native D3D11 window. Nothing about the
//      receive path needs porting, which was the objection that looked fatal.
//
// The glass loop owns the frame timing and calls pump() once per frame, which
// is where Qt's timers, sockets and queued signals actually run. No IPC, no
// second process, no serialisation boundary.
//
// Deliberately plain types across this seam: the page fragments are ImGui code
// including headers from a foreign project, and handing them QString or
// QObject would drag Qt's moc and include order into that world for nothing.

// Run Qt's event loop for this frame, and throttle the frame rate when the
// window is not in front.
//
// Must be called from the render loop or nothing Qt-driven ever fires: no
// discovery, no sockets, no timers.
//
// The throttle is here rather than at another patch site because this is
// already called once per frame. liquidDX11 redraws continuously, which is
// right for a showcase and wrong for a utility that sits open all day - it
// measured around 50% of an integrated GPU doing nothing. A backgrounded
// window has nobody looking at it, so it does not need 60fps.
void pump();

// Whether this frame is worth drawing at all.
//
// The real saving is not a lower frame rate, it is not rendering. A utility
// that sits open all day changes nothing on screen for minutes at a time, and
// every frame it draws in that state is a GPU cycle spent on an identical
// image - the swapchain still shows the last frame presented, so skipping
// costs nothing visually.
//
// Sleeps before returning false, so the caller can `continue` without spinning
// the loop. Returns true whenever the user is interacting, the window has just
// come forward, or the core reports something new.

// ── Streaming ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The real SenderController, the same one the shipping app drives: DXGI
// duplication into a hardware H.264 encoder, one virtual display per
// receiver. Nothing here reimplements any of it.

// Extend onto a receiver: it gets a virtual display of its own, so the desktop
// grows rather than repeating. width/height of 0 means "match this PC".
//
// Returns false if no display could be claimed - see lastLogLine() for why,
// since the reasons are worth reading rather than reducing to a bool.

// Mirror this PC's main screen onto a receiver, the way the macOS sender's
// "Mirror Built-in" does. No virtual display is involved and nothing is
// resized, so what the receiver shows is what is on the monitor.
//
// Windows can duplicate a display only once, so a second receiver cannot
// mirror the same screen at the same time; that returns false with the reason
// in lastLogLine(). There is no size argument for the same reason - the screen
// is whatever size it already is.

// Whether this PC's main screen is already going to some receiver, so the UI
// can say why mirroring to a second one is not on offer.

// ── Per-device stream settings ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Remembered per device rather than globally, matching the macOS sender where
// clicking a connected display gives you that display's resolution and
// bitrate. A phone wants a different size from a laptop, and having set it
// once you should not have to set it again.
//
// Keyed by device name, not address: a phone that comes back tomorrow on a
// different IP is still the same phone and should keep its settings.

// ── Android over USB ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The one feature that runs the other way. Everything else here sends this
// PC's screen somewhere; this shows an Android phone's screen on this PC,
// over the USB cable, using scrcpy and adb - the tools Google and Genymobile
// already ship for it, bundled beside the exe rather than reimplemented.
//
// adb is not run until asked. Starting it leaves a daemon behind on the
// machine, which is not something to do to someone who never opened this
// panel, so watching is something the user switches on.

// ── Identity ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// never will, but the chip is a good place for the name this machine
// advertises itself under, which is a real setting rather than decoration.

// ── Asking another device for its screen ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The reverse of everything else here: instead of sending this PC's screen
// out, this asks a Mac to send its screen to this PC, so the Mac never has to
// be touched. Extend gives this PC its own virtual display over there; Mirror
// duplicates the Mac's main screen.
//
// The request travels to the sender's invite port as
// [4B big-endian length][JSON], carrying `type` 99 and `keyCode` 770 - the
// shape InviteListener on this side already accepts - plus the mode and the
// port to dial back on.
//
// This only works against a sender that listens for it, and as of BetterCast
// 18 the macOS app does not. Rather than offer a button that fails, the UI
// asks first: whoever is listening on the invite port can be asked, and
// whoever is not is shown as not ready. That means the day the Mac gains the
// listener, this side needs no change at all.
