# BetterCast

BetterCast is an open-source screen extension app that turns almost any device into a wireless extra display for your Mac or Windows PC. Think Sidecar or AirPlay Receiver — but cross-platform and built for hardware Apple no longer supports, right down to using an old 5K iMac as a Thunderbolt display.

## How It Works

**BetterCast** is a single unified Mac app that does both jobs: it can **send** your screen to other devices (creating a virtual display per receiver) and **receive** screens from other Macs in a separate window. Receivers on iOS, Windows, Linux, and Android are dedicated apps.

Each connected receiver gets its own virtual display with independent resolution, input handling, and optional audio streaming.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Role | Connection | Download |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| **macOS** | Sender + Receiver | P2P Direct / WiFi | [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) |
| **iOS / iPadOS** | Receiver | P2P Direct (AWDL) / WiFi | [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) |
| **Windows** | Sender (beta) + Receiver | WiFi | [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) |
| **Linux** | Receiver | WiFi | [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) |
| **Android** | Receiver | WiFi / ADB USB | [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) |

## Features

- **Multi-device** — Connect multiple receivers simultaneously, each with its own virtual display
- **Cross-platform input** — Mouse and keyboard pass-through from any receiver back to the Mac
- **Audio streaming** — Optional per-device AAC-LC audio forwarding (128 kbps stereo)
- **Adaptive quality** — Per-link tuning: AWDL P2P runs 60 FPS at full bitrate; WiFi infrastructure runs 30 FPS at the user-selected bitrate (default 20 Mbps) with shorter keyframe intervals for faster recovery on lossy links; ADB tunnels match P2P quality
- **Zero-config for Apple devices** — iOS/Mac receivers are discovered automatically via AWDL (no WiFi network needed)
- **mDNS discovery** — Windows/Linux/Android receivers are discovered automatically when on the same network

## Installation

### macOS (Sender + Receiver)

1. Download the latest DMG from [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install)
2. Open the DMG and drag **BetterCast** to your Applications folder
3. Launch **BetterCast** and grant the required permissions:
   - **Screen Recording** — to capture your display
   - **Accessibility** — to relay mouse and keyboard input from receivers

The receiver auto-starts in the background — no need to "switch modes". To send your screen, pick a discovered device from the sidebar. To receive, just leave the app open and another Mac/iOS device will see you in their list.

### iOS / iPadOS

The iOS receiver is [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6761002383). It is not yet available in the EU while App Store trader-status verification is pending.

### Windows

Download the installer from [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) and run `BetterCastReceiver.exe`. Both devices must be on the same WiFi network.

### Linux

Download the AppImage from [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install). Make it executable (`chmod +x`) and run. Both devices must be on the same WiFi network.

### Android

Visit [bettercast.online](https://bettercast.online/#install) for the latest APK. Supports WiFi and USB via ADB tunnel.

## Networking

BetterCast uses **TCP (port 51820)** for the primary video/audio stream and **UDP (port 51821)** for chunked frame delivery. Service discovery uses mDNS (`_bettercast._tcp`).

- **Apple-to-Apple**: Uses AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link) for a direct P2P connection — no WiFi router needed
- **All other platforms**: Requires both devices to be on the same WiFi/LAN network
- **Hotspot**: If no shared network is available, create a hotspot on any device and connect the Mac to it

### Wire Protocol

Frames are sent as length-prefixed TCP messages with a 1-byte type tag:

```
[4-byte big-endian length] [1-byte type] [payload]
  type 0x01 = H.264 video (AVCC NALUs, no Annex B start codes)
  type 0x02 = AAC-LC audio (raw frames, no ADTS header)
```

Legacy receivers (pre-1.3 iOS / Mac Swift) use a different framing without the type byte; the desktop receiver auto-detects the format on the first frame of each connection.
